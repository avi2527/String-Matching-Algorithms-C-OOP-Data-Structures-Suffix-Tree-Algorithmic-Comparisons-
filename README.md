# String-Matching-Algorithms-C-OOP-Data-Structures-Suffix-Tree-Algorithmic-Comparisons-
Implemented - The Knuth-Morris-Pratt, The Boyer-Moore, Rabin-Karp Algorithms to compare the run time. Compared Bit-Oriented Approach and AhoChorasick Algorithm for the string search efficiency. Used Suffix Tree to search string patterns.
